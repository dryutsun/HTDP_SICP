; Racket Syntax Teminology
; The whole expression is called "a call to a primitive"
; This oprator acts on 'operands'
; RACKET Evaluation:
; To Evaluate a Primitive Call,
; FIRST reduce operands to values i.e. each small primitive call must be reduced
; to a value.
; THEN apply the primitive to the values.
; TLDR -- Primitive Calls are evaluated from the inside out and from left to right.
