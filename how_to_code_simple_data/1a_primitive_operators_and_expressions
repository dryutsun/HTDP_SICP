(+ 3 (* 2 3))
(sqrt 16)

; PROBLEM:
; assume that the two short sides of a right triangle have a length of 3 and 4.
; what is the length of the long side? Write an expression in BSL that produces
; the value of x

(sqrt (+ (sqr 3) (sqr 4)))

; if you take the square root of 2...
(sqrt 2) ; this is an irrational number, it takes infite space...
